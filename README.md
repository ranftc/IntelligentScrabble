# IntelligentScrabble

Date Start: 4/20/2020

Language: Python

Required to run:
- Collins Scrabble Words(2019).txt

Problem: Use Artifical Intelligence concepts in some project using Python

Design: Created an intelligent Scrabble opponent that used path finding and fitness algorithims to optimize its score each move. It is single player so the computer vs person. The program requires a text file of potential words deliminated by new line. I used the Collins Scrabble Words(2019).txt file which is attached.

Result: The game runs as a print out in the console but still has some bugs like sometimes allowing illegal scrabble moves
