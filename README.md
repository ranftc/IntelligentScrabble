Problem: Use Artifical Intelligence concepts in some project using Python

Design: Created an intelligent Scrabble opponent that used path finding and fitness algorithims to optimize its score each move. It is single player so the computer vs person. The program requires a text file of potential words deliminated by new line. I used the Collins Scrabble Words(2019).txt file which is attached.

Result: The game still has some bugs that were discovered while playing the game. Sometimes it allows an illegal scrabble moves
